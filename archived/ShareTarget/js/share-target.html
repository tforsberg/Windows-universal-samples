                Your share target app should report completed after the share task completes successfully. This API applies to both quick
                and long-running shares.
            </p>
            <div id="quickLinkArea">
                <p>
                    When reporting completed, you can optionally add a QuickLink to make it easier for users to repeat the way they share
                    most often. This saves them from having to select that person or group in your app every time they share to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If no user interaction is required, you can dismiss your share target programatically while continuing to execute
                    a task in the background. (e.g - Uploading a user selected file in the background)

                This API is required if your app supports uploading a format that may take some time, such as images or videos.
                A user should be able to dismiss your app and have the upload continue in the background while they do other things.
                In order for the dismiss behavior to work correctly, you need to report to the share platform that you finished getting
                user input.  After you call this, a user can go back to the share pane and see your application in the share progress
                list.

                This API is optional and helps Windows to optimize resource usage of the system.  You should report this if you have finished
                extracting data from the Data Package so that Windows can suspend or terminate the source app as necessary to reclaim
                system resources.
                <br /><br />
                <button id="reportDataRetrieved" class="win-button">Report Data Retrieved</button>
                <br /><br />
                This API is optional and helps Windows to optimize resource usage of the system.  You should report this if you have called
                the Windows Runtime Background Transfer class to upload your content.  Then Windows can suspend your app as necessary
                to reclaim system resources. If you use this API, call it after Report Started.

                <button id="reportSubmittedBackgroundTask" class="win-button">Report Submitted To BackgroundTask</button>
                <br /><br />
                If for any reason the long-running share was unsuccessful and failed in the background, you should report failure and
                include a message for the user about how they can recover from the error.  When the user goes back to the share pane
                they can see your message in the progress list. You must never call Report Error if your app is visible in the
                foreground.
